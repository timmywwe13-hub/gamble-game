Start your run, hacker. The house always wins... unless you rewrite the rules.

## Overview
Neon Double-Down is a cyberpunk-themed high-stakes dice gambling game. You play as an infiltration unit hacking into a corporate vault using "chips" as your processing power. Manage your resources, upgrade your systems (luck), and use special abilities to beat the odds.

-   **Progression System**:
    -   **Upgrades**: Purchase "Loaded Dice", "Safety Nets", "Lucky Charms", and more from the Upgrade Shop.
    -   **Classes**: Unlock and choose different classes like the *Gambler* or *Hacker* for unique bonuses.
